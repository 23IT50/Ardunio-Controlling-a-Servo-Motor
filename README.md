# Ardunio-Controlling-a-Servo-Motor
Learn to control a servo motor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino microcontroller. The code moves the servo to various angles, allowing you to see how to interact with servo motors using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

#Components Used
Arduino board (e.g., Uno),
Servo motor,
Jumper wires

#Circuit diagram connections
Servo Motor:
Connect the signal pin of the servo to pin 9 on the Arduino.
Connect the power (Vcc) pin of the servo to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the ground (GND) pin of the servo to the GND pin on the Arduino.
